def: "OBSOLETE. Catalysis of the reaction: (5-L-glutamyl)-peptide + an amino acid = peptide + 5-L-glutamyl-amino acid." [EC:2.3.2.2]
comment: This term was obsoleted because it does not correspond to a physiological reaction.\nUsage comment: The gene family commonly referred to as gamma-glutamyl transferases (GGT) catalyze hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl bonds in gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione. In a test tube one can set up conditions in which the enzyme will transfer the gamma-glutamyl portion of the substrate to an acceptor molecule, but this requires non-physiologic conditions, including millmolar concentrations of an acceptor such as glygly. This reaction is used in assays to detect the presence of the enzyme, but is not a physiological function of members of the GGT family (PMC4388159), which should be annotated to a suitable hydrolysis term instead (e.g. glutathione hydrolase activity).
